  \caption[Illustration of Canalization Against Bilateral Asymmetry in \textit{Drosophila melangoster}]{This cartoon summarizes an artificial selection experiment performed on \textit{Drosophila melangoster}. In treatment $i$, selection is made for a bilaterally symmetric trait --- overall decreased eye size in this illustration. However, in treatment $ii$ artificial selection for a non-bilaterally symmetric trait --- relatively smaller right eye size --- fails \cite{Tuinstra1990LackDevelopment}.}
