  \caption[Schematic of Interplay between Concepts Related to Evolvability]{A graphical illustration of how causal factors related to evolvability interact. Green solid arrows indicate promotion while red dashed T's indicate suppression. Ultimate causal factors are depicted with a triangular glyph. Intermediate causal factors are depicted with a square glyph. Evolvability and its two major conceptual components are drawn with circular glyphs. Table \ref{table:index} lays out where these relationships are described in the text. Blue asterisks indicate terminology unique to this work.}
