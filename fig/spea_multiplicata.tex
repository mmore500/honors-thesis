  \caption[Illustration of Indirect Plasticity in \textit{Spea multiplicata}]{An illustration of the alternate phenotypic forms of \textit{Spea multiplicata}. Form $i$ is known as the omnivorous form while form $ii$ is known as the carnivorous form. Developing tadpoles assume one or another of these forms on the basis of environmental signaling, thought to be the consumption of brine shrimp \cite{Pfennig1992PolyphenismStrategy}.}
